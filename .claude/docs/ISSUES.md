## Open Issues

- **ID:** ISSUE-021
- **Date:** 2026-03-27
- **Status:** open (blocked — likely Meta platform bug)
- **Category:** HIGH / Integration
- **Description:** Threads OAuth authorize endpoint returns "No app ID was sent" despite `client_id` being in the URL. The "Generate Access Token" button in Meta Developer Portal works fine for the same app — proving config is correct.
- **Suspected cause:** Meta platform bug — the OAuth authorize endpoint on `threads.net`/`www.threads.com` is not reading the `client_id` query parameter.
- **Found in:** Threads OAuth flow
- **Resolution:** Pending — Threads moved to "Coming Soon"

- **ID:** ISSUE-024
- **Date:** 2026-03-27
- **Status:** open (ManyChat removed, code fixes deployed — ready for clean end-to-end test)
- **Category:** HIGH / Integration
- **Description:** Instagram DM automation — multiple issues found and fixed:
  1. Removed invalid `POST /{ig_id}/subscribed_apps` call (Facebook Pages only)
  2. Instagram comment field mismatch — uses `text` not `message` (error #100). Fixed: try IG fields first, fall back to FB.
  3. Instagram DM endpoint — uses `POST /me/messages` not `POST /{ig_user_id}/messages` (error #3). Fixed.
  4. ManyChat was intercepting webhooks — user disconnected (2026-03-28)
  5. OAuth scopes: `instagram_business_*` names break Facebook Login — reverted to `instagram_*` names. See CLAUDE.md "Do Not Attempt" #14.
- **What to do next:**
  1. Run SQL cleanup: `DELETE FROM dm_conversations;`
  2. Publish NEW Instagram post with DM automation attached
  3. Have Sharon comment with trigger keyword
  4. Check Coolify logs for `[DMAgent] Started` and `[MessagingService] Sending private reply via instagram`
  5. If no webhook: check Page-level webhook subscriptions in Meta Developer Portal
- **Found in:** `backend/services/messagingService.js`, `backend/workers/dmWorker.js`
